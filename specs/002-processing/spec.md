## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an Analyst, after a URL has been processed into a card, I want to review the AI-generated data, edit it for accuracy, and then submit the corrected card to my Manager for final review.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a card has been generated with `status: 'ready'`, **When** I open the card, **Then** I can see all the AI-enriched metadata (title, summary, author, etc.) and a link to the original source.
2. **Given** I am reviewing a card, **When** I edit the title and summary and click save, **Then** my changes are persisted and the card now displays the updated information.
3. **Given** I have finished reviewing and editing a card, **When** I click "Submit for manager review", **Then** the card's state changes to `reviewStage: 'awaiting_manager'` and it is removed from my review queue.
4. **Given** the AI-generated content is poor, **When** I trigger a "rescan" on the card, **Then** the system re-processes the original URL to try and generate better data.

### Edge Cases
- **What happens when** I try to save a card with required fields (like title) left empty? The system should prevent the save and show a validation error.
- **How does the system handle** edits if the underlying content is rescanned while I am editing? The system should notify me of the conflict and allow me to review the differences before saving.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST process queued URLs by scraping, summarizing, and enriching them with metadata to create a "card".
- **FR-002**: The system MUST persist the enriched card data, including an audit trail of the original scraped data versus user edits.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST track and display the processing status of a card (e.g., `queued`, `processing`, `ready`, `error`).
- **FR-004**: The system MUST provide an interface for Analysts to edit the content of a generated card (e.g., title, summary, author).
- **FR-005**: The system MUST record the identity of the editor and the timestamp for every saved change.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST allow an Analyst to trigger a "rescan" of the source URL to re-run the enrichment process.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST allow an Analyst to submit a card for Manager review, which transitions its `reviewStage` to `awaiting_manager`.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST prevent a card from being submitted for review if mandatory fields are not complete.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Card**: The central object representing a processed URL, containing all its metadata, edit history, and status.
- **ArticleRecord**: The underlying data structure for a card, including both the original scraped content and any subsequent edits.
- **Edit History**: An audit log for a card, tracking every change made by a user, including who made the change and when.
