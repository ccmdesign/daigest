## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Manager, I want to review a queue of cards that my Analysts have submitted, so that I can curate the content for our newsletter by either shortlisting cards for the next issue, saving them for a future issue, or returning them for more work.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am in the manager review workspace, **When** I open my queue, **Then** I see a list of cards with the `reviewStage: 'awaiting_manager'`.
2. **Given** I am reviewing a card, **When** I click "Shortlist for next issue", **Then** the card's `reviewStage` is updated to `shortlisted` and it is added to the upcoming newsletter issue.
3. **Given** I am reviewing a card that is good but not timely, **When** I click "Save for later", **Then** the card's `reviewStage` is updated to `saved_for_later` and it is moved to a separate backlog.
4. **Given** I am reviewing a card that needs more work, **When** I add feedback notes and click "Return to analyst", **Then** the card's `reviewStage` is updated to `needs_revision` and the original Analyst is notified.

### Edge Cases
- **What happens when** two managers try to edit the same card simultaneously? The system should prevent concurrent edits or provide a merging mechanism. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the desired behavior for concurrent edits?]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a dedicated workspace for Managers to review cards submitted by Analysts (`reviewStage: 'awaiting_manager'`).
- **FR-002**: The system MUST allow Managers to edit the content of a card during their review.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST allow a Manager to transition a card to the `shortlisted` stage, indicating it is approved for the next newsletter.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST allow a Manager to transition a card to the `saved_for_later` stage, moving it to a backlog for future consideration.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST allow a Manager to transition a card to the `needs_revision` stage, returning it to the Analyst with feedback.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST record the Manager's identity and the timestamp for all review actions.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST provide separate views or filters for the main review queue, the shortlist, and the saved-for-later backlog.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Card**: The central object that is being reviewed and curated.
- **Issue**: Represents the upcoming newsletter. Shortlisted cards are associated with an issue.
- **Backlog**: A collection of cards that have been `saved_for_later`.
