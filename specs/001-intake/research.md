# Research: Intake Module

## Form Handling in Vue/Nuxt
- **VeeValidate**: A popular library for form validation in Vue. It can be used to handle the validation of the URL input form.
- **Zod**: Can be used for schema declaration and validation on both the client and server to ensure the submitted data is in the correct format.
- **Nuxt `useFetch`**: The built-in `useFetch` composable is the standard way to make API calls from the Nuxt frontend to the server API routes.

## Decisions
- We will use the built-in features of Nuxt 3 as much as possible for form handling and API communication to keep dependencies low.
- Basic regex validation on the client-side will provide instant feedback to the user.
- Comprehensive validation will be performed on the server-side API endpoint.
