## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an Analyst, I want to paste a list of URLs into a web form so that the system can process them and create enriched "cards" for my review.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am on the intake page, **When** I paste a single valid URL into the form and submit, **Then** the system enqueues the URL for processing and I see a confirmation.
2. **Given** I am on the intake page, **When** I paste multiple valid URLs (one per line) into the form and submit, **Then** the system enqueues all the URLs for processing.
3. **Given** a URL has already been processed and exists as a card, **When** I try to submit the same URL again, **Then** the system informs me that it is a duplicate and does not re-process it.

### Edge Cases
- **What happens when** I paste a mix of valid and invalid URLs? The system should accept the valid ones and show an error for the invalid ones.
- **How does the system handle** URLs that are not articles (e.g., a link to a YouTube video or a PDF)? The system should attempt to process them, and the resulting card should reflect the content type.
- **How does the system handle** submission of an empty form? The system should prevent the submission and inform the user that input is required.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a web form with a textarea for users to input URLs.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST accept one or more URLs, separated by newlines.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST validate the format of each submitted URL.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST normalize URLs to a standard format to aid in de-duplication.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST check for and prevent the submission of duplicate URLs that have already been processed.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST enqueue valid, non-duplicate URLs for the Processing module.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST provide immediate feedback to the user on the status of their submission (e.g., success, number of URLs submitted, errors for invalid URLs).

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **URL**: A web address submitted by the Analyst for processing.
- **Card**: The resulting object created by the Processing module from a submitted URL. The Intake module's primary output is the trigger to create a Card.
