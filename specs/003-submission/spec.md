## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an Analyst, once I have finished reviewing and editing a card, I want to submit it to my Manager, signaling that it is ready for the next stage of review.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am viewing a card that I have finished editing (`reviewStage: 'analyst_review'`), **When** I click the "Submit for manager review" button, **Then** the card's `reviewStage` is updated to `awaiting_manager`.
2. **Given** a card has been submitted, **When** I view my personal review queue, **Then** the submitted card no longer appears in my list.
3. **Given** I attempt to submit a card that has missing required information, **When** I click the "Submit" button, **Then** the button is disabled and the system shows me an error explaining what needs to be completed.

### Edge Cases
- **What happens when** a Manager is not available or assigned? The system should place the card in a general `awaiting_manager` queue.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a "Submit for manager review" action on cards that are in the `analyst_review` stage.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST validate that a card meets all completeness criteria (e.g., no empty required fields) before allowing submission.
- **FR-003**: Upon successful submission, the system MUST transition the card's `reviewStage` from `analyst_review` to `awaiting_manager`.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST record the identity of the submitting Analyst and the timestamp of the submission.
- **FR-005**: Once submitted, the card MUST be removed from the Analyst's active review queue and appear in the Manager's review queue.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST provide a clear confirmation to the Analyst that the submission was successful.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Card**: The central object being acted upon. The submission action changes its `reviewStage` attribute.
