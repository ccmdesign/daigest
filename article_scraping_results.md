> From Interim to Institution: New Jersey’s Three-Pillar Strategy for Responsible AI In July, Code for America named New Jersey (opens in new window) one of only three states with “advanced” AI readiness. That honor recognizes how we have combined policy, access, and training into a coherent strategy for using AI responsibly in government.

Its purpose was to encourage responsible experimentation at a moment when generative AI tools were brand new and untested in government....

> Ten years ago, the Roosevelt Institute published “Technology and the Future of Work: The State of the Debate.“ We got some important things right—particularly our insight that technology was “underlying and enabling a vast reorganization of both corporations and the overall economy” and our focus on how technological change was reducing “both the political and workplace power of American workers.” But we also got crucial things wrong. We anticipated gradual change over decades, not the AI revolution marked by market concentration that arrived in just a few years. We worried about platform...

This insight cuts to the heart of why 25 years of "e-democracy" experiments haven't transformed...
