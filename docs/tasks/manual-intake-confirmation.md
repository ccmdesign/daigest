# Task: Manual Intake Confirmation Flow (Deferred)

This task tracked an experiment to stage URLs before processing so Analysts could confirm links prior to enrichment. The flow has been rolled back in favour of the original pipeline (submit → process → Analyst reviews generated cards).

Future analyst review work will shift to the Processing module, where card-level edits and approvals belong.

No further action required here.
